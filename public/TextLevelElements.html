  <h1>Soccer Time:</h1>
  <p>
    This is how I look to catagorize the soccer events that should be watched.
    I usually first head to the following <a href=
    "https://www.mybucketlistevents.com/11-best-soccerfootball-events-around-world/"
    target="_blank">link</a> to see what events are going on around the <em> world</em>.
    There are usually a good mix of events that could played so I take a note of them.
    Then I start looking what <strong>teams</strong> play at which events. This is
    actually very crucial since it determines how interesting that event might be
    <small>(This is soleley my preference and is not a sole advice)</small>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are three main events that I like to pay attention to.
    <ol>
      <li>
        World Cup
      </li>
      <li>
        <s>Olympic Soccer</s>
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn><abbr title="Union of European Football Associations">UEFA</abbr></dfn>
        is a European champions league and one of the most popular leagues in the
        world.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it comes the time to get the times and dates of the games so I could manage
    the best watching option since as quote says <q>life is a soccer field, don't
    you think?</q> <cite>Shakira, <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/shakira"
    target="_blank">soccer quotes</a></cite>. This is truly a great event for many
    and brings everyone together to watch and root for their teams. <i>However some
    may have a total different view and call it a boring sport that 22 people are
    running after a ball to score very few points.</i>
  </p><br />

  <h2>How to watch Soccer:</h2>
  <p>
    Like any sporting event soccer has its own manner of watching and there are
    quite interesting.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <mark>A man cave</mark>
      </li>
      <li>
        Some beer, but it is always better to have some<sup>2</sup> beer on hand
      </li>
      <li>
        Wings, <data value="1090">chips</data>, and <data value="1091">dips</data>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ruby><rb>Big </rb><rt>screen TV</rt></ruby>
      </li>
      <li>
        Some H<sub>2</sub>O in case you get dehydrated.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Now these are the basics but there are <var>x</var> number of additional things
    that you can add to the side and enjoy the game which I usually do. Also if you
    running a linux distribution type the following command into your terminal and
    hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to avoid <b>paying</b> some fee for watching the game.
    <code>sudo pip install livestreamer</code> However the error may appear <samp>
    pip: command not found</samp> in case you don't have python and pip installed
    on your machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Something to keep in mind too is the time of the event as some of the events
    usually start passed the <time >00:00:00</time> and that is pretty late for
    many of us. So it is good to plan and have a <u >good sleep</u> before or after the
    event.
  </p>
  <p>
    Soccer in farsi is called football and spelled <bdo dir="rtl"><bdi>فوتبال</bdi></bdo> which makes
    more sense because it is being played by foot at all times. <wbr>The<wbr> game
    <wbr>is<wbr> very<wbr> inetersting<wbr> but<wbr> the<wbr> culture<wbr> around<wbr> it
      <wbr>makes<wbr> it<wbr> more<wbr> entertaining.
    In all cases <span class="soccer"> soccer could be an exciting sport to follow</span>
    so give it a try.
